      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        Section 5: Frequently Asked Questions<br>
Frequently Asked Questions<br>
What is a .com domain? A .com domain is your business name on the Internet. It's like a global registration of your brand online, allowing you to use it for your personalized business email or to create your own website in the future.<br>
What if I already have my own domain? This promotion is only for NEW .com domains. If you already have your domain and want to use our business email service, WordPress cloud hosting, or web design, please contact us first.<br>
Is my own web domain free forever? Yes, unlike other services that charge extra for domain registration, your .com domain is completely free with us as long as you maintain our service. This promotion covers your .com web domain, the most commercial and globally recognized domain, and does not apply to regional or country-specific domains.<br>
What is a forwarding account? A forwarding account is linked to your main email address. For example, if your main email is yourname@tunegocio.com, you can have a forwarding account called sales@tunegocio.com. Emails sent to the forwarding account are automatically forwarded to your main account. It's a way to have multiple email addresses for your business, appearing more professional without any extra cost.<br>
Do I have to configure the Cloud Hosting WordPress service myself? No, that's what sets us apart. We handle all the technical configurations for you. Your website will be delivered 100% ready, installed, and configured. We will provide your WordPress username and password, and as a courtesy, we will install the necessary premium plugins for your project.<br>
Is web design a one-time payment? Yes, it is. The $197 you pay includes both the design and the first year of the Cloud Hosting service. Once the design is completed, you'll receive your fully manageable website in Spanish. You can manage it yourself or assign the task to your staff. In the following years, you only need to pay $97 for the Cloud Hosting service.<br>
