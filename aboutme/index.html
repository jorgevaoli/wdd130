    <h2>Jorge Valverde</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jorge, and I am from Peru, a country 
    known for having one of the world's finest gastronomies. And yes, 
    of course, I am a big fan of "Pollo a la Brasa," "Lomo Saltado," 
    and "Ceviche." Even though I can prepare these amazing dishes, I 
    tend to be a bit slow in the kitchen, so I prefer to savor and 
    enjoy them.</p>
    <p>Another thing I love is reading books, especially physical ones. 
    I'm sorry, but nothing compares to the magic moment of smelling and 
    starting a new book. A couple of years ago, I started to read English 
    books, and this definitely changed my life. Thanks to this  I gained 
    self-confidence and finally decided to start my second career, but 
    this time I decided to do it in English.
    The first career that I studied was International Business 
    Management, and now I have decided to become involved in the growing 
    and exciting world of technology. This is the big reason why I am 
    here, trying to do my best to achieve a bachelor's degree in Software 
    Development.</p>
